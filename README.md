# Datapond 

Datapond is a platform for sharing news and market data to facilitate analytics. Datapond allows users to create an account through the site or through Facebook. Once logged in, they are able to create and view data packages, and their associated documents. Data packages are research questions/ topics; the documents are the answers to those questions. 

Any particularly good data package can be favorited by the user, to be accessed later on.

Datapond is up on heroku and can be found here:
