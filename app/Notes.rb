1. Add the route 
2. Add the controller 
3. Add the views (Or start here and go backwards)


Under the Data package show page:
# <% My steps: %> 
# <% Adding the favorites to the data package show page so i dont have to make %> 
# <% a new page %> 
# <% Maybe practice making a new page anyways, like with the %> 
# <% top 10 favorited data packages or something %>
