<h4> What is datapond? </h4>
<p> As a trends researcher, I've noticed that certain questions are asked repeatedly.
For example, we're pitching a possible new bank client. Instead of a consultant gathering trends and stats 
about the consumer banking industry or the client itself- something that 5 different project teams have done in the past 6 months- 
let's make one research package that encompasses trends in fintech, consumer behavior, spending patterns, disruptors in the industry, etc. </p>
<p>Datapond's goal is to create a repository of secondary research to help accelerate the fact gathering process.
